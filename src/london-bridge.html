<h1>London Bridge</h1>
<p>
  Several bridges named London Bridge have spanned the River Thames between the
  City of London and Southwark, in central London. The current crossing, which
  opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and
  steel. It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn
  superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval structure. This was preceded by
  a succession of timber bridges, the first of which was built by the Roman
  founders of London.
