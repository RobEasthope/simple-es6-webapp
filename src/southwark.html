<h1>Southwark</h1>
<p>
  Southwark (/ˈsʌðərk/ SUDH-ərk) is a district of Central London and is the
  north-west of the London Borough of Southwark. Centred 1 1⁄2 miles (2.4 km)
  east of Charing Cross, it fronts the River Thames and the City of London to
  the north. It was at the lowest bridging point of the Thames in Roman Britain,
  providing a crossing from Londinium, and for centuries had the only Thames
  bridge in the area, until a bridge was built upstream more than 10 miles (16
  km) to the west. It was a 1295-enfranchised (nationally represented) Borough
  in the county of Surrey, apparently created a burh in 886, containing various
  parishes by the high medieval period, lightly succombing to City attempts to
  constain its free trade and entertainment. Its entertainment district, in its
  heyday at the time of Shakespare's Globe Theatre (which stood 1599-1642) has
  revived in the form of the Southbank which overspills imperceptibly into the
  ancient boundaries of Lambeth and commences at the post-1997 reinvention of
  the original theatre, Shakespeare's Globe, incorporating other smaller theatre
  spaces, an exhibition about Shakespeare's life and work and which neighbours
  Vinopolis and the London Dungeon. After the 18th century decline of
  Southwark's small wharves, the borough rapidly grew in population and saw the
  growth of great docks, printing/paper, railways, goods yards, small artesan
  and other often low-wage industries and Southwark was among many such inner
  districts to see slum clearance and replacement largely with social housing
  during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is now at an advanced stage
  of regeneration and has the City Hall offices of the Greater London Authority.
  At its heart is the area known as Borough, which has an eclectic covered and
  semi-covered market and numerous food and drink venues as well as the
  skyscraper The Shard. Another landmark is Southwark Cathedral, a priory then
  parish church created a cathedral in 1905, noted for its Merbecke Choir.
