# Simple ES6 Webapp

A simple single page app built for an agency technical test. It doesn't use any frameworks and just uses ES6 Vanilla.js code to do some DOM and JSON manipluation to display JSON data and HTML markup without the need for a full routing solution.

All code identifying the agency in question has been removed.
